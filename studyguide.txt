#Goal: Familiarize yourselves with Flutter's core concepts and basic UI building blocks.

Day 1-2: Set up Flutter environment, explore basic widgets (Text, Container, Column, Row, etc.)
Day 3-4: Create your first simple app (e.g., a profile page), understand Stateless and Stateful widgets.
Day 5: Learn about Flutter layouts (Padding, Align, Expanded, Flex), start creating responsive UIs.

#Week 2: Introduction to GetX for State Management
#Goal: Master the basics of GetX state management.

Day 1-2: Understand what GetX is and why it's useful, install GetX package, learn basic state management (GetBuilder, Obx).
Day 3-4: Explore GetX routing, practice navigation using Get.to, Get.back, and Get.off.
Day 5-6: Create a multi-screen app (e.g., a navigation drawer with a home, settings, and about page), implement GetX navigation.
Day 7: Refactor your code to fully use GetX for state management, discuss key takeaways.

#Week 3: GetX Routing and Dependency Injection
#Goal: Learn how to manage app navigation and dependencies using GetX.
Day 1-2: Implement GetX in your existing project (from Week 1) for state management (e.g., managing to-do list items).
Day 3-4: Practice more with GetX by adding a counter or login screen with form validation.
Day 5-6: Learn GetX Dependency Injection (Get.put, Get.lazyPut, Get.find), apply it in your project for controller management.
Day 7: Refactor your project by injecting dependencies using GetX, review navigation flow.

#Week 4: API Integration with GetX
#Goal: Learn to work with APIs using GetX and handle network requests.

Day 1-2: Understand basics of APIs and HTTP requests, install Dio or http package.
Day 3-4: Make GET requests to a public API (e.g., fetch weather or movie data), and display results in your app.
Day 5: Handle API responses using GetX (GetConnect), practice error handling and loading states.
Day 6-7: Build a small project with API integration (e.g., fetching and displaying user profiles or product lists).


##Tips for Success:

Dedicate 1-2 hours per day for learning.
Work on mini-projects to reinforce concepts.
Review each otherâ€™s code to learn collaboratively.
